# Prompt Manager Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- [x] Template setup and configuration
- [x] PostCSS configuration fix
- [x] Basic build and development server working
- [x] Component architecture refactoring completed
- [x] Search functionality implemented
- [x] Tag management system implemented
- [x] Export functionality (JSON, CSV) working
- [x] Chrome storage integration complete

## Dependencies & Setup
- [x] Install Fuse.js for search functionality
- [x] Install marked.js + highlight.js for markdown parsing
- [x] Add Chrome extension type definitions
- [x] Set up testing framework (Vitest/Jest)

## Component Architecture ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created PromptCard component for individual prompt display
- [x] Created SearchBar component with search input
- [x] Created TagFilter component for tag filtering
- [x] Created ExportMenu component for export functionality
- [x] Created PromptEditor component for edit/create forms
- [x] Created PromptList component for main list view
- [x] Created ErrorBoundary component for error handling
- [x] Created ErrorMessage and LoadingSpinner components
- [x] Refactored App.tsx to use modular components

## Core Functionality Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Replace template App.tsx with actual prompt manager interface
- [x] Implement Chrome storage API integration
- [x] Build search functionality with real-time filtering
- [x] Add comprehensive tag management system
- [x] Implement export features (JSON, CSV)
- [x] Add copy to clipboard functionality
- [x] Implement error handling and loading states


## Storage Decision: Chrome Storage ✅ FINAL
- [x] **Decision**: Stick with Chrome Extension Storage (`chrome.storage.local`)
- [x] **Rationale**: Perfect for personal use, offline-capable, no costs, private
- [x] **Capacity**: Up to 10MB storage (plenty for prompts)
- [x] **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts, computer reboots, Chrome sync
- [x] **Security**: Isolated from websites, requires extension uninstall to delete

### Testing Strategy
- [x] **Development**: Use `npm run dev` for UI/components testing
- [x] **Storage Testing**: Build extension + load unpacked for Chrome storage testing
- [x] **Build Process**: `npm run build` → Load `dist/` folder in Chrome extensions
- [x] **Manual Testing**: Create prompts, reload extension, verify persistence

## Chrome Extension Specific Features
- [x] Chrome storage permission handling (storage permission in manifest.json)
- [ ] Popup UI optimization for extension constraints
- [ ] Extension lifecycle management
- [ ] Performance optimization for popup loading

## Enhanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Implement Fuse.js for advanced fuzzy search
- [ ] Create markdown preview component using marked.js
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting with highlight.js
- [ ] Implement tag editing and deletion UI
- [ ] Add markdown export functionality
- [ ] Implement search history and favorites

## Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for components and utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for search and storage
- [ ] Chrome extension loading tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Deployment
- [ ] Production build validation
- [ ] Chrome extension packaging
- [ ] Documentation update
